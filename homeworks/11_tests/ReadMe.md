### Description

As you might have noticed the calculator from the exercise 2 is buggy and far from perfect. 
So you are to write a real thing: production-ready calculator! 
Try to cover it with tests as much as possible. Check the coverage level with [scoverage](https://github.com/scoverage/sbt-scoverage) and improve it if possible. 
Note that the point of this exercise is not to write something complicated but to write tests and play with code coverage. What you write is up to you and you can choose more entertaining topic if you like.
