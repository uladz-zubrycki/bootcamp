### Description

```
/**
 * HOMEWORK:
 *
 * Some classes and generated JSON codecs are provided for NBA API.
 * Unfortunately, they don't work as expected out of the box.
 * The task is to fix (rewrite) some of the codecs to make tests pass.
 * You are not supposed to change anything in _class_ HomeworkSpec,
 * instead of it you are supposed to keep your changes inside _companion object_ for HomeworkSpec.
 *
 * You are not allowed to rename fields in case classes.
 * You are not allowed to remove fields from case classes.
 * You are supposed to use camelCase if you introduce additional fields in case classes.
 *
 * It would be nice to avoid using Encoder/Decoder.forProductN where you specify all field names
