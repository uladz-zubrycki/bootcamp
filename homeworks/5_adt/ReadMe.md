### Description

Algebraic Data Types homework.

Define all algebraic data types, which would be needed to implement “Hold’em Hand Strength”.
You can model concepts like:
1. Suit
2. Rank
3. Card
4. Hand (Texas or Omaha)
5. Board
6. Poker Combination (High Card, Pair, etc.)
7. Test Case (Board & Hands to rank)
8. Test Result (Hands ranked in a particular order for a particular Board, accounting for splits)

Make sure the defined model protects against invalid data. Use value classes and smart constructors as
appropriate. Place the solution under `adt` package in your homework repository.
