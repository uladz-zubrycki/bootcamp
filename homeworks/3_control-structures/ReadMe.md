### Description

​
Commands are:
​  divide 4 5 which should output "4 divided by 5 is 0.8"
​  sum 5 5 6 8.5 which should output "the sum of 5 5 6 8.5 is 24.5"
​  average 4 3 8.5 4 which should output "the average of 4 3 8.5 4 is 4.875"
​  min 4 -3 -17 which should output "the minimum of 4 -3 -17 is -17"
​  max 4 -3 -17 which should output "the maximum of 4 -3 -17 is 4"

​In case of commands that cannot be parsed or calculations that cannot be performed,output a single line starting with "Error: ".
