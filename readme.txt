Solution is implemented in the FSharp language, hence dotnet SDK is required. 
You could either build your image based on ubuntu:latest image, by running prepare.sh script or
base you image on mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:latest, where required sdk is installed already.

Run run.sh to process the data then.
